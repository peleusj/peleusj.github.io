R is so fascinating; I will definitely continue to dive deeper into it."

    "section": "Thoughts About Tableau Viz Extension",
    "text": "Thoughts About Tableau Viz Extension\nAlthough the Tableau Viz Extension is a significant feature of Tableau released recently, I found that there are still some areas for improvement. For instance:\n\nThe flexibility of Chart Format is relatively low, especially in the Level Label, where you cannot adjust its position to both outside which is quite common in Sankey chart, and the font colors are not consistent in color palette, some are black, some are white.\nCurrently, only Tableau’s own Sankey Extension supports publishing to Tableau Public.\nWhile there are some third-party extensions available, but many require purchase, and I haven’t tested whether I can publish them to Tableau Server yet.\n\nTherefore, I personally think that while the Tableau Viz Extension looks promising, Tableau still have a lot of work to do. I will continue to keep an eye on it."
